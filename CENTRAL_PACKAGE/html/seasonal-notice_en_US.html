        Novanet is pleased to announce our Food for Fines program will be running from February 5th&ndash;25th. Bring in a non-perishable food item to any participating academic library in Nova Scotia and we will waive fines for every item donated (some exceptions apply, ask staff for details). For more information about our Food for Fines program, contact your home library.

      Novanet will be moving to a new library interface on May 17th. Our preparation for this move means you will not be able to place holds after May 8th or renew material after May 10th until we start using our new catalogue. Please contact your library after May 17th for help in accessing our new search interface.
