        Novanet is pleased to announce our Food for Fines program will be running from October 15th to November 4th. Bring in a non-perishable food item to any participating academic library in Nova Scotia and we will waive $3 in fines for every item donated (some exceptions apply, ask staff for details). For more information about our Food for Fines program, contact your home library.
